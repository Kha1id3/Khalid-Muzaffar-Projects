// Task 3

Method isEqual1 will return True because int is an immutable primative data type it is having the same memory adress so the operator == will give true
Method isEqual2 will retur False because interger is an mutable warper class so it has diffrent memory adress so the operator== will give false



//Task 4
True //using the == operator we the comparing the memory of s1 and s2 since the both have same moemory asdress in string pool is true.
True  //using the .equals() method we are comnparing the content(not adresss) of the strings and since they are same its true.
False //since here we created a new string object so the adress are different it will give false.
True //since the content is same "foo" it will reutrn true.
