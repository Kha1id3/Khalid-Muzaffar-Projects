# Academic Projects and Labs

Welcome to my GitHub repository, which showcases a collection of academic projects and labs completed during my Applied Computer Science studies. This portfolio highlights a range of topics including web development, mobile app development, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Key Projects

### 1. **Pinder iOS Application**
A unique mobile app developed for iOS, designed to help pet owners find matching pets for breeding. Similar to Tinder but for pets, Pinder connects users based on their pets' profiles, breeds, and preferences. It features a swipe-to-match system, integrated chat for communication between pet owners, and a safe, user-friendly interface. Developed using Swift, the app ensures a smooth experience with real-time updates and reliable matchmaking algorithms.

### 2. **ToBeFit Mobile Application (Flutter)**
A fitness app built using Flutter that allows users to purchase and follow different workout plans, while tracking their progress. The app offers personalized workout routines, goal-setting, and progress tracking features, ensuring a comprehensive fitness experience. It includes a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to stay on top of their fitness goals, regardless of their skill level.

### 3. **Group Trip System Web App**
A web application designed to help groups plan and manage trips. Users can create itineraries, track expenses, and communicate with other group members. The app is built using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend in Node.js.

### 4. **Second-Hand Marketplace Web App**
A marketplace for buying and selling second-hand goods, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Features include user registration, product listings, and secure payment gateways. This project was developed using React for the frontend and Express for the backend, integrating a MongoDB database.

### 5. **IoT Raspberry Pi Elevator Project**
A project completed as part of an IoT course, where two Raspberry Pi units were used to simulate an elevator system. One Raspberry Pi acted as the elevator, with LED indicators showing the current floor, movement status, and door operations. The second Raspberry Pi represented the floor, with LEDs indicating when the elevator was called to the floor. An MQTT broker was used to facilitate real-time communication between the two systems, displaying the floor number and controlling the elevatorâ€™s actions, including door opening and closing.

## Other Projects and Labs
