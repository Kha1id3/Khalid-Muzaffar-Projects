First of all we need to know what this  "Bad magic number in super-block" error mean. 
It means that the filesystem you are trying to resize has become corrupted or damaged.

This step is possible way to fix it hopefully.

 Since the error is in superblock we meed to Check the backup superblock: The superblock contains critical information about the filesystem, and the "bad magic number" error may indicate that the primary superblock is corrupt. 

In this case, we can try using one of the backup superblocks to repair the filesystem. 


By Running the command 
dumpe2fs /dev/mapper/abc-data | grep -i superblock

 to find the locations of the backup superblocks. 

Then use the command
 fsck -b <superblock_location> /dev/mapper/abc-data 

to repair the filesystem using a specific backup superblock. 

Ofc we need replace <superblock_location> with the actual location of the backup superblock that we want to use.

 
 Just to make sure we can also :
Unmount the device: Make sure that the /dev/mapper/abc-data device is not currently mounted. WE can check if the device is mounted by running the mount command. If the device is mounted, 
unmount it using the command 
umount /dev/mapper/abc-data
